   <h1>MY WORK BIO</H1>
    <p>Here's my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorkennedy">LinkedIn</a>. 
    <p>Some highlights from my work in both law and policy:

Brown Act, the California Public Records Act, the California Education Code, and state and federal privacy laws. I also represent clients in state and federal court and before the Office of Administrative Hearings (<a href="https://conorkennedy.website/docs/2019020613.pdf">here's</a> a recent example).

     <summary>Broadband and Privacy in City Hall</summary>
     <p>From 2016 to 2018, I worked in San Francisco City Hall at the Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation.
     <p>I drafted the official privacy and net neutrality requirements for the citywide fiber network plans San Francisco developed under Mayor Ed Lee and Mayor Mark Farrell, which established and advanced a new framework adopted by other cities (e.g., pg 18 of <a href="https://www.clickcabletv.com/about/click-rfi/">Tacoma, WA procurement docs</a>) and formally recognized by the <a href=https://www.fcc.gov/document/commr-clyburn-sf-mayor-farrell-joint-statement-broadband-access>FCC</a> and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/public-internet-option?redirect=muni-broadband-report">ACLU</a>.
